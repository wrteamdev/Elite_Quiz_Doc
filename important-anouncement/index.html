            <h3> Important Announcement: Changes to Premium Categories</h3>
            <span>We're making significant changes to how Premium Categories and Subcategories work starting with
                version v2.2.3. To give you time to prepare, we're informing you now so you can decide whether to update
                to the new version or stay on the current one. </span>

            <b class="question">What's changing?</b>
            <span class="answer">Currently, you can make both Categories and Subcategories premium. While this offers
                flexibility, it's
                caused complexity issues in the app and made it difficult to manage different quiz features like Battles
                and Self Challenges.</span>
            <span>To simplify the app and improve performance, we're changing the system so that <b>only Categories can
                be premium</b>. Subcategories will no longer have premium options.</span>

            <span class="question"><b>What does this mean for you?</b> </span>
            <li>
                - <b>If you want to continue using the current system with premium subcategories</b>, you can stay on
                version v2.2.2.
            </li>
            <li>
                - <b>If you're okay with only premium Categories</b>, you can update to version v2.2.3 when it's released
                on August 12, 2024.
            </li>
            <span>We understand this change might affect your quiz app, so you have time to adjust your Categories and
                Subcategories before the update.</span>

            <span>To help you visualise the differences, we've included diagrams showing how the system works now and
                how it will work after the change.</span>
